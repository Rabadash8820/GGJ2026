The game itself is a 2D rhythm game, where the notes represent the player "following the script" of being a retail grocery worker in order to "mask" their emotions while dealing with difficult customers.
The name is a melodramatic riff on [_Devil May Cry_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devil_May_Cry).

Keyboard controls:

- <kbd>1</kbd>-<kbd>4</kbd> or <kbd>A</kbd>-<kbd>F</kbd>: play one of the four possible notes
- Escacpe: pause
